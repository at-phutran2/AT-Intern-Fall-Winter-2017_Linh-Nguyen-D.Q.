1> What are the differences between a variable that is: `null`, `undefined`?
  -> undefined is unknown value. When you declare a variable but it isn't assigned value => the value of the variable is undefined
  -> null means that the value is null or does not exist, it can be used to assign a variable as non-valued value.

2> What is `use strict`? what are the advantages and disadvantages to using it?
  -> Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a "strict" operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.
  -> Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:
  It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.
  It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively "unsafe" actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).
  It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

3> What are the differences between `==` and `===`? Write an example for each case (if any)?
  -> == only compare value, === compare value and value type.
  -> Example:
    1 == "1" => return true;
    1 === "1" => return false;

4> What is different between declaration: `var`, `const` and `let`?
  -> var creates a variable whose scope is accessed throughout the function that contains it.
  -> let creates a variable that is only accessible in the block that surrounds it.
  -> const is similar to let, but it is used to declare a constant - is a value that can not be changed during the run.
